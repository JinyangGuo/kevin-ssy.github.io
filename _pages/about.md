I recently received my M.Phil. degree from the [the University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/), where I was with the [SIGMA Lab](https://sigmalab-usyd.github.io/),
 [School of Electrical & Information Engineering, ](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-electrical-and-information-engineering.html) and was supervised by Professor [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io). 
I received a B.Eng. degree in 2016 in Software Engineering from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/), China. 
My research interest is to develop robust and intelligent algorithms related to computer vision and deep learning.
